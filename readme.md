# ~/.dotfiles
Insert dumb story about how I got a new Mac and I'm finally going to take my ~/.dotfiles seriously. As I go through setting up my machine, I'll add as much as possible to keep everything automated and clean. 

### Main Goals:
- Consistant across my machines.
- Terminal/iTerm settings
- Editor - Visual Studio Code (Current Go to), Atom, Sublime Text 3
    - It'd be great if they all had the things I like when coding
- Dev tools and main prefs for them: NVM/Node, RVM/Rails, Vagrant/Virtualbox, etc
- Common apps that have settings I can save
- Environment credentials (Github, Heroku, etc)
- Common Aliases and functions
